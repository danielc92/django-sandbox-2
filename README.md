# Notes
- When created a model/form class which uses ImageField make sure request.FILES is passed into form model (eg DogForm(request.POST, request.FILES))
- When uploading files make sure `MEDIA_ROOT` and `MEDIA_URL` are set for usage in `DEBUG` mode. Additionally make sure media is added to urlpatterns in `urls.py`
- When creating a model/form class which uses ImageField make sure `enctype="multipart/form-data"` is present in the form attributes.
- Adjust timezone in settings.py. Timezone strings can be found in django docs
